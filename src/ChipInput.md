The chip input is used to allow selecting multiple text values. The component is highly customizable and supports everything you would expect from a form component as it is based on Material-UI's `FormControl`.

```
<ChipInput
  defaultValue={['clown fish', 'whale', 'shark']}
  fullWidth
  label='Fish and chips'
  placeholder='Type and press enter to add chips'
/>
```
